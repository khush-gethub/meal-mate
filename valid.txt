To ensure the application is secure and reliable, "midnight blog" uses a multi-layered validation strategy. This serves as the primary method of system testing and is broken down into three layers.

1. Frontend (Client-Side) Validation
Frontend validation provides immediate feedback to the user, improving the user experience and reducing unnecessary server requests. This is implemented using HTML5 form validation attributes and JavaScript.

      What it checks:
     Required Fields:  Ensures that mandatory fields (e.g., username, email, password) are not left empty.
     Data Formats:  Validates that the entered data conforms to the expected format (e.g., 	 a valid email address format).
     Password Strength: Checks for a minimum password length and complexity (e.g., requiring a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
     Input Length: Enforces minimum and maximum length constraints on input fields.

2. Backend (Server-Side) Validation
Backend validation is the primary line of defense against invalid or malicious data. It is essential because client-side validation can be bypassed. The backend validation is implemented in the Node.js/Express.js application using middleware and validation libraries.

What it checks:
     Data Integrity: Verifies the correctness and consistency of the data before it is saved 	 to the database.
     Uniqueness: Ensures that certain fields, such as email addresses, are unique across  all user accounts.
     Business Logic: Enforces application-specific rules (e.g., preventing a user from liking the same recipe twice).
     Sanitization: Cleanses input data to prevent security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.

  3. Authentication & Authorization Validation

Authentication and authorization are crucial for securing the application and protecting user data. This is handled on the backend using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

What it checks:
    User Identity: Verifies the user's identity by validating the JWT provided with each request.
    Access Control: Ensures that users can only access the resources and perform the actions they are authorized for. For example, only an administrator can access the admin dashboard and manage users and recipes.
    Session Management:Manages user sessions, ensuring that users remain logged in until they explicitly log out or their session expires.
