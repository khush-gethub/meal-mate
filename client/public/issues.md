### AxiosError in Cards.jsx

**Description:** The client-side application is encountering an `AxiosError` with a "Request failed with status code 404" when attempting to fetch recipes from `http://localhost:3005/api/recipes/${type}`. This indicates that the request to the backend server is failing because the specific API endpoint is not found.

**Potential Causes:**
1.  The API endpoint `http://localhost:3005/api/recipes/${type}` is incorrect or not properly defined on the server.
2.  The server is running, but the route handler for this endpoint is missing or misconfigured.

**Resolution Steps:**
1.  Examine `server/index.js` to verify the API endpoint definition and ensure a proper route handler exists for `/api/recipes/:type`.
